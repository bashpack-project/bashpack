After you're satisfied of your code (it means it must be tested):
- Edit the $VERSION in bashpack.sh with the new version 
- Commit to the dev repository
- Create a new release & tag with the same version written in $VERSION earlier
- Test on a Linux that the update is working as expected with: sudo bp -u 


Workflow:
Main <- [Unstable <-> Dev]

Main is the stable repository that host the usable CLI. The code stored on this repository must work.
Unstable purpose is to test updates process coming from Dev. The code stored on this repository can not work.
Dev purpose is to develop new features. The code stored on this repository can not work.
