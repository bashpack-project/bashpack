After you're satisfied of your code (it means it must be tested) :
- Edit the $VERSION in bashpack.sh with the new version 
- Commit to the working branch
- On Github, merge the working branch to main
- Create a new release & tag with the same version written in $VERSION earlier
- Test on a Linux that the update is working as expected with: sudo bp -u
