# This is the main Bashpack configuration file.
# Here are provided defaults options, and their values can be changed.
# This file can meet several modifications within futures updates. Any value configured here will remain after updates.

# How to use ?
# A single space is necessary to match options with their values:
# <option> <value>

# [option] publication can be "main", "unstable" or "dev"
# - Production systems should always be configured with "main"
# - "dev" and "unstable" are meant for development use only, you should never use them.
publication main

# [option] firewall can be "auto" or "disable"
# - auto = let manage the firewall with Bashpack. Default is inbounds = closed and outbounds = open. You can add custom rules within the firewall configuration.
# - disabled = do not manage the firewall with Bashpack
firewall disabled
